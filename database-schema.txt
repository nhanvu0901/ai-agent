        law_id: (String) - The law_id of the parent Law, for context.
        full_path: (String) - A constructed path for easier unique identification (e.g., "328/1991 Sb._part:ČÁST PRVN").

Head: Represents a head or chapter within a Part of a law (e.g., "HLAVA I").

        full_path: (String) - A constructed path (e.g., "328/1991 Sb._part:ČÁST PRVN_head:HLAVA I").

Paragraph: Represents a paragraph, typically denoted by "§" (e.g., "§ 1").
    Properties:
        identifier: (String) - The identifier of the paragraph (e.g., "§ 1").
        text: (String) - The textual content of the paragraph.
        law_id: (String) - The law_id of the parent Law, for context.
        full_path: (String) - A constructed path (e.g., "328/1991 Sb._part:ČÁST PRVN_head:HLAVA I_para:§ 1").

Subsection: Represents a nested subsection within a Paragraph or another Subsection (e.g., "(1)", "a)").
    Properties:
        identifier: (String) - The identifier of the subsection (e.g., "1", "a").
        text: (String) - The textual content of the subsection. This might include concatenated text if the subsection itself has further nested textual elements in the JSON.
        law_id: (String) - The law_id of the parent Law, for context.
        full_path: (String) - A constructed path (e.g., "..._para:§ 1_sub:1_sub:a").

UnresolvedReference: Represents a reference made by a law where a specific target law_id could not be automatically extracted from the reference text.
    Properties:
        text: (String) - The original text of the reference.

Relationship Types:

ENFORCES: Connects an Agency node to a Law node.
    (Agency)-[:ENFORCES]->(Law)

REFERENCES_LAW: Connects a Law node to another Law node that it references.
    (Law)-[:REFERENCES_LAW {reference_text: string}]->(Law)
    Properties:
        reference_text: (String) - The original text string of the reference.

HAS_UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE: Connects a Law node to an UnresolvedReference node when a specific law ID couldn't be parsed from a reference.
    (Law)-[:HAS_UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE]->(UnresolvedReference)

HAS_PART: Connects a Law node to its Part nodes.
    (Law)-[:HAS_PART]->(Part)

HAS_HEAD: Connects a Part node to its Head nodes.
    (Part)-[:HAS_HEAD]->(Head)

HAS_PARAGRAPH: Connects a Head node (or a Part node if paragraphs are directly under parts) to its Paragraph nodes.
    (Head)-[:HAS_PARAGRAPH]->(Paragraph)
    (Part)-[:HAS_PARAGRAPH]->(Paragraph)

HAS_SUBSECTION: Connects a Paragraph node to its top-level Subsection nodes, or a Subsection node to its nested Subsection nodes.
    (Paragraph)-[:HAS_SUBSECTION]->(Subsection)
    (Subsection)-[:HAS_SUBSECTION]->(Subsection)

Indexes and Constraints (as defined in initializeSchema):

Constraints (for uniqueness and faster lookups/merges):
    On (l:Law) for property law_id.
    On (a:Agency) for property name.

Indexes (for faster lookups):
    On (l:Law) for property title.
    On (p:Part) for properties (identifier, law_id).
    On (h:Head) for properties (identifier, law_id).
    On (p:Paragraph) for properties (identifier, law_id).
    On (s:Subsection) for properties (identifier, law_id).
